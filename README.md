This is a project made for the Cloude class for my 2 year IoT studies.

When I started this project I did NOT have a clear goal in mind and I started building on it without many requirements.
This is the main reason the code may use 'users' in some areas and 'tags' in others. 
For your sanity, please beware that they've become synonymous and I simply haven't refactored the code to us 'tags' only.
